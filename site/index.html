      <h2>Shea Stadium Concert</h2>
      <h5>August 15th, 1965</h5>

      <p>On this date throughout The Beatles career they performed  at Shea Stadium to a total of 55,000 people in the audience, this performance had been the highlight of the bands tour. From the performance each member had stated something: "It's like this: you make a noise and they make a noise, and it's the noise together that counts. It's the bible, really, with Cecil B. De Mille and 60,000 extras." - Paul , "It was marvellous. It was the biggest crowd we ever played to, anywhere in the world. It was the biggest live show anybody's ever done, they told us. And it was fantastic, the most exciting we've done. They could almost hear us as well, even though they were making a lot of noise, because the amplification was tremendous." - John, "Shea Stadium was an enormous place. In those days, people were still playing the Astoria Cinema at Finsbury Park. This was the first time that one of those stadiums was used for a rock concert. Vox made special big 100-watt amplifiers for that tour. We went up from the 30-watt amp to the 100-watt amp and it obviously wasn't enough; we just had the house PA." - George, "I never felt people came to hear our show - I felt they came to see us. From the count-in on the first number, the volume of screams drowned everything else out." - Ringo.

      <p> This album had been recorded in a 10 hour session obtaining 10 out of the 14 tracks on the album, the final tracks were finalized in the days following; so technically it wasn't created in a day but the majority was! The band was in the middle of a tour and George Martin wanted them to record so they could push out the album quickly.<a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/history-one-day-beatles-record-please-please-me"> Source - Udiscovermusic </a></p>

      <p> Before The Beatles there was <i> The Quarrymen </i>! During this time they would do small local gigs, both John and Paul. They didn’t know how big of a band they’d soon become! There's also an AWESOME movie about the foundation of <i> The Quarrymen </i> it's called Nowhere Boy.<a href="https://beatles.fandom.com/wiki/The_Quarrymen"> Source - The Beatles Wiki </a></p>
